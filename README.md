## Welcome to the 2020 Summer School of the Memory of Motion EU Project

This MEMMO Summer School focuses on Control for Legged Robots. The school is articulated around three introduction tutorials based on tools developed within the [MEMMO](http://www.memmo-project.eu/) consorcium:
- [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio): A fast and flexible implementation of Rigid Body Dynamics algorithms and their analytical derivatives.
- [TSID](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/tsid): Efficient Task Space Inverse Dynamics based on Pinocchio.
- [Crocoddyl](https://github.com/loco-3d/crocoddyl): An optimal control library for robot control under contact sequence. Its solver is based on various efficient Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP)-like algorithms.

The school is **free of charge** and all the materials are freely accessible and will be avaible on this webpage. 

Expected prerequisite:
- Linear Algebra.
- Basic Robotics and Control.
- Basic Optimization.
- Basic Python.

If you are participating to the event at the scheduled time slots (July 7/8/9, from 10am to 5pm **CET**), please follow the indications in [Participate](/summer-school/participate).

If you want to acess recordings and materials, all the links are available in [Materials](/summer-school/materials).

If you have any issue or question, please contact @mathieu_geisert:matrix.org by matrix or mathieu@robots.ox.ac.uk by e-mail.
