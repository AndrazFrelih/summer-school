## Welcome to the 2020 Summer School of the Memory of Motion EU Project

This MEMMO Summer School focuses on Control for Legged Robots. The school is articulated around three introduction tutorials based on tools developed within the [MEMMO](http://www.memmo-project.eu/) consortium:
- [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio): A fast and flexible implementation of Rigid Body Dynamics algorithms and their analytical derivatives.
- [TSID](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/tsid): Efficient Task Space Inverse Dynamics based on Pinocchio.
- [Crocoddyl](https://github.com/loco-3d/crocoddyl): An optimal control library for robot control under contact sequence. Its solver is based on various efficient Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP)-like algorithms.

The school is **free of charge** and all the materials are freely accessible and will be avaible on this webpage. 

Expected prerequisites (levels):
- Linear Algebra (good).
- Robotics and Control (basic).
- Optimization (basic).
- Python (basic).

The event will run from the 7th till the 9th of July, from 10am to 5pm **CET** each day (see [Schedule](/summer-school/schedule)).

If you intend to [Participate](/summer-school/participate), please follow the instructions within.

Otherwise, all related materials, including videos, can be found in [Materials](/summer-school/materials).

If you have any issue or questions, please contact @mathieu_geisert:matrix.org by matrix or mathieu@robots.ox.ac.uk by e-mail.
