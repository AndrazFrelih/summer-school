# Join Memmo on Matrix

The main chatroom for the Memmo 2020 Summer School is
[#memmo-ss20:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#memmo-ss20:matrix.org)


If you don't already have a matrix account, you can follow those instructions to join us:

1. Go to https://riot.im/app/ application and create an account on the matrix.org homeserver.

    Filling the E-mail field is recommended (as this enable the "recover a lost password" feature), but it will block
    your use of the app until you click on the link sent by mail. You can also leave this field empty, and setup an
    e-mail to your account later.

2. Encryption is not used for the Memmo 2020 Summer School chatrooms, so you can skip its setup.

    However, if you are a crypto geek, here is what's happening: all devices used with your account will generate a
    private key / public key pair to encrypt messages. So if you loose your device, you will not be able to decode
    your old messages on encrypted chatrooms again. To prevent this, Riot asks you to setup a strong passphrase, so that
    it can backup an encrypted version of your keys on matrix.org servers.

3. Once logged into Riot, you can join us at [https://riot.im/app/#/room/#memmo-ss20:matrix.org](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#memmo-ss20:matrix.org)

If you have any issue or question, please contact @gsaurel:laas.fr by matrix or gsaurel@laas.fr by e-mail.
