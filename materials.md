For tutorials, software can be installed using [the repositories](/summer-school/repositories) but to avoid compability issues we recommend to use the following [Virtual Machine](/summer-school/virtual_machine) or [Docker container](/summer-school/docker).

Saddly, due to a problem on the BigBlueButton server, the videos of the lectures have been lost.
However, lectures on TSID and pinocchio of the previous winter school can be found on the [MEMMO youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAIn7ZmDGY7ChSWQE3IMhLA/featured). 

If you want to access all the questions that were asked during the event, you can access the chat rooms [#memmo-ss20:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#memmo-ss20:matrix.org) (here are [instructions](/summer-school/matrix) on how to join).
