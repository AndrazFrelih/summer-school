# Participate

This summer school is a fully virtual event.

For the videoconference system, we are using BigBlueButton. To join the meeting, use the following link [https://seminar.laas.fr/b/gui-u11-1ox](https://seminar.laas.fr/b/gui-u11-1ox) at the [scheduled time slots](/summer-school/schedule).

Tutorials are based on Python notebooks. Software can be installed using [the repositories](/summer-school/repositories) but to avoid compability issues we recommend to use the following [Virtual Machine](/summer-school/virtual_machine) or [Docker container](/summer-school/docker).

For direct communication, we are using Matrix. Please join the main room [#memmo-ss20:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#memmo-ss20:matrix.org) (here are [instructions](/summer-school/matrix) on how to join) for the latest information on the event.

For the practical-work sessions, questions can be ask on Matrix. For each tutorials, students will split into different rooms with a teaching assistant (about 4 groups for each tutorial). Please, follow the indications posted on the main room [#memmo-ss20:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#memmo-ss20:matrix.org) to know which tutorial room to access. In each tutorial room, you will find 3 three panels:
- the main chat where you can ask questions to your teaching assistant and interact with the other students of the room.
- the "FAQ" notepad is writable only by teaching assistants. This document is used to share relevant questions across all rooms.
- the "Debug" notepad is writable by everyone and can be used to share code with your teaching assistant to help debugging.
